## How to run this?

Step 1: Run `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` (Make sure that the terminal is at the folder address)

Step 2: Run `gradient_descent.py`

Step 3: Open `animation.gif` to see the gradient descent process!

Step 4: Try to learn something from it

## What have I done?

You are given the class for 2-variable function. I also provide some code to plot the graph as a 2D contour graph (kindly find in `function_plot.py`).

## What do you need to do?

Implement gradient descent for this function and create something similar to animation.gif
