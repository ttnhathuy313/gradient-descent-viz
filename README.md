## How to run this?

Step 1: Run `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` (Make sure that the terminal is at the folder address)

Step 2: Run `gradient_descent.py`, you will see the gradient descent process of fixed step size, Wolfe's condition, and backtrack approach. You can always zoom in the Matplotlib graph to see more clear.

Step 3: Open `_____.gif` to see the gradient descent process!
